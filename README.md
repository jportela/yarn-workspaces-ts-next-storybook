# Yarn Workspaces TS Next Storybook

This is an example project, with a minimal setup for incorporating the following base concepts/technologies:

* [Monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo), through [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/)
* [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React Framework for the web app
* [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), for developing/consuming the UI Library

## Instructions

```bash
yarn install # install dependencies
yarn storybook # open the UI Library Storybook
yarn dev # start a dev server for the Web App
```

## Setup Guidelines

I intend to write about the steps I took, but they can be somewhat followed by [checking the commit history](https://github.com/jportela/yarn-workspaces-ts-next-storybook/commits/master).
